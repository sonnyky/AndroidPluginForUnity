# AndroidPluginForUnity

This is a plugin to use Android native functions on Unity. The original purpose was to enable Google's Voice Recognition API from
inside Unity so this is heavily geared towards voice recognition but it can also serve as a starting point for anyone trying to write their
own Android-Unity plugin.
